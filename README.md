# Moon 
This repository was created for Moon, a React-inspired language. Moon doesn't require any libraries or servers; everything you need is in this repository.
## Description
Just as the moon has phases, front-end web development also evolves in different stages. That's why the name Moon fits perfectly. You don't need servers or external programs: everything you need is right here, in this folder.
## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. in the /components folder is where the new .mn files will be created.
3. In index.html it will only add the renders of the .mn files.
4. Once you have the render and the .mn files, you will need to run the executables for your operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows).
5. When you run the compiler you will need to open the index.html file, I am currently working on a better system.

## Version
Moon is currently in beta (v1). For now, you can write HTML code like in React and it can be reused.
